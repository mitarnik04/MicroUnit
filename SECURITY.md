## Supported Versions

Since MicroUnit is currently in it's beta phase we don't have to worry about suppling older versions with security updates.  
Therefore this section is a thing for the future...  
Be sure to check back in once MicroUnit get's officially released. 

> **Note:** Once available we will show a table of the supported versions here !!
