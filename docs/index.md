## Quick Start

1. **Install MicroUnit**  
   Add MicroUnit to your project using Composer:

   ```sh
   composer require your-vendor/microunit --dev
   ```

2. **Create your microunit.config.php**
   Create `microunit.config.php` in your current working directory or any parent directories:

   > Note: All paths are going to be resolved relative to the location of your config file.

   ```php
   <?php
   use MicroUnit\Config\MicroUnitConfigBuilder;
   use MicroUnit\Output\MinimalStringTestWriter;

   return MicroUnitConfigBuilder::create()
       ->withTestDir('./tests')
       ->addTestFilePattern('*Test.php') // If not configured '*-tests.php' will be used
       ->addTestWriter(new MinimalStringTestWriter()) //If not configured MinimalStringTestWriter will be used
       ->build();
   ```

3. **Write your first test**
   Create a test file in your specified test directory (or any child directory) and start testing.

   ```php
   use MicroUnit\Assertion\Assert;
   use MicroUnit\Setup\TestSetup;

   $tester = TestSetup::getTester("YOUR_TEST_SUITE_NAME");
   $tester->define('my_first_test', function(){
        Assert::equals(2, 1 + 1);
   })
   ```

4. **Run Your Tests**  
    Use your preferred test runner or CLI integration.

   ```bash
   vendor/bin/microunit
   ```
